A personal multipurpose expandable discord bot written with discord.py as a personal project for a few years.  
 
Current features include an archive system, written so RP Servers are able to condence a server worth of non-ooc RP messsages into a single channel, while grouping them into clusters based on chronological order and the names of the original channels.


Utilizes SQLAlchemy to store persistent data into a SQLLite3 database.

**Requirements:**
 + discord.py
